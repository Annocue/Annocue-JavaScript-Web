        Welcome to Annocue! My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicasioanderson/">Nick Anderson</a>. <strong>Annocue is an organization that is both transparent (literally) and will scale with society.</strong><br /><br />

        Before I digress into the business of things, let me provide some context for my dedication to Annocue. During a camping trip, a couple years after university, I had a conversation with a consultant and how he thought people lose their ideas when they join the real world (i.e. 'get a job'). I agreed, we give to companies and they give to those who invest in their business. <strong>What if we invested in society I said? What if everyone could learn if they wanted?</strong> Instead of businesses only looking for people already at the top of their game, what if we could build around people who could see the future? I took finance, I learned computer science, and even got my MBA but never really liked the process to get a job as a developer; here is where my skills correlated into Annocue. In Annocue, I see the bridge between knowledge and true organizational transparency.<br /><br />

        <strong>Now you may think what is the goal of this organization? Simply put, to organize and connect people, organizations, and communities.</strong> Not the typical how much time you spend using our services, but contributing to our code to run services you want. Coding is like reading, everyone should be able to automate the boring jobs and wasted effort. I see this as an organization that allows you to control what you want, while at the same time only communicating with those individuals, organizations, and communities you deem worth your time.<br /><br />

        On the other hand, you might simply look at this as a GitHub for social networks and services. You don't have to contribute and you could simply clone/fork the repositories for your own use. However, I believe we can scale if we work together. Everyone from anywhere in the world! Think of how we could help companies find the right people, find the right people to serve our communities, and make life that much less bureaucratic personally and professionally.<br /><br />

        <strong>If you want to learn Go, JavaScript, and/or Python, please fork our <a href="https://github.com/Annocue">repositories</a>!</strong> If you can help with deployment, testing, and adding additional functionality, please submit a pull request. Annocue is in the first two years of incubation (ready by 2020), there will be lots of testing and rewrites of the data and the functionality. I expect I'll be meeting many who share the same mindset and we'll have lots to discuss! Find me on <a href="https://github.com/nicasioca">GitHub</a>.<br /><br />

        P.S. Part of the reason I chose Annocue is because it starts with the letter 'a'. I also love cues in everything I do, the little patterns in everything we do. In Italian 'anno' means 'year' and originally in Latin it meant 'in the year'. Lastly, I liked the play on words ‘an-no-cue’ and it doesn't hurt the letters add up to a lucky prime number of 7.
