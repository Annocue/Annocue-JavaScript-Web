        Welcome to Annocue! Pronounced an-no-cue. In Italian 'anno' means 'year' and in Latin it means 'in the year'. While 'cue' is seen in the context of a signal to perform, it is also a play on the word queue. I would define Annocue as a queue of actions performed over time. That said, I, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicasioanderson/">Nick Anderson</a>, would like to cue your world with Annocue!<br /><br />

        Now you may think what is the goal of Annocue? Simply put, to organize and connect people, organizations, and communities. Not the typical how much time you spend using our services, but also being able to learn and contribute to our code to run services you want. Coding is like reading, everyone should be able to automate the boring jobs and wasted effort. I see this as an organization that allows you to control what you want, while at the same time only communicating with those individuals, organizations, and communities you deem worth your time.<br /><br />

        If you want to learn Go, Java, JavaScript, and/or Python, please contribute our <a href="https://github.com/Annocue">repositories</a>! If you can help with deployment, testing, and adding additional functionality, please submit a pull request. I expect many share the same mindset!
